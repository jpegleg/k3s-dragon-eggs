# This might be a good place to enforce some node labels for different hosts,
# especially if firewall rules might involve differences between nodes in the cluster.
# The example sets a host called "bottle2" to the role "worker".
#kubectl label node bottle2 node-role.kubernetes.io/worker=worker 2>/dev/null
# Then apply BGP hostendpoint autoconfiguration for calico 
calicoctl patch kubecontrollersconfiguration default --patch='{"spec": {"controllers": {"node": {"hostEndpoint": {"autoCreate": "Enabled"}}}}}'
# Then apply our manifest for calico global network policy, that apply across the whole cluster, including the underlying hosts.
calicoctl apply -f /root/dragon-network.yml
